1. I made a color-tracking rover (vehicle). So you'll need                                                                                 
    1. A rover kit
    2. Arduino kit
    3. OpenCV installed on your PC
    4. Arduino software
    
The folder "Rover" contains the final code of the project.

2. Arduino Project to make your laptop behave differently when subjected to different motions. So you'll need
    1. Arduino Kit
    2. 5 Ultrasonic sensors
    3. pyautogui package
    4. OpenCV
    
While installing 'pyautogui', run pip install pyautogui.
Make sure you used the pip install from Github because the pip file on python.org has some error in its code.
